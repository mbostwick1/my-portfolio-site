 - This project was a good exercise for multiple reasons. First, to apply the HTML/CSS information I have learned to build a functional site. Second, to get more familiar with Bootstrap components/capabilities and apply a custom CSS to style the pre-existing elements. Third, to follow a redline/guidelines set forth by a client.

## Installation
 
 - Created a repo on GitHub and cloned it to my local drive.
 
 - Created all .htmls and assets folder including css and images. The images used were screenshots and placeholder recreations in photoshop. 
 
 - The header/navbar were implemented first. I pulled the navbar that made the most sense from Bootstrap and customized the elements in the CSS. 
 
 - I started with the About me page because it felt like the most complicated out of all 3. I established the repeating background pattern, the white aside, headline, line break, figure, paragraphs of lorem, and footer. 
 
 - Once I had the elements in the index.html, I was able to start applying the CSS styling elements. 
 
 - The header, navbar, background pattern, white aside, headline, line break, and footer were then repurposed throughout the remaining .html docs (portfolio and contact).
 
 - The portfolio didn't seem too complicated so instead of using bootstrap, I stuck with the simplicity of img tags with placeholders and alt tags. I sized for retina (700x700px). I am a digital designer and typically double the pixels for a clear resolution. I established the width/height in the css.
 
 - The contact.html includes a form fom bootstrap. This was very straightforward and the only challenge for me was styling the submit button. After a quick google search, I was able to find the exact css elements to create the sharp edges, customize the color, included a hover with a darker teal, increased the margin for a sizable button, and included padding to separate the button from the bottom of the aside.

 
 - Lastly, I had to troubleshoot the footer because it was overlapping the content. I was able to solve this by adding the footer height to the bottom padding of the white box.
